# dual-use-1writer-nvalt-links
A Javascript action for 1Writer that generates a block of text with a 1Writer link and an nvALT link to the current file. My use case is to link to text files from the note field of an OmniFocus action. OmniFocus syncs across iOS and macOS, so if I have a text file that is relevant to a particular action, I want to be able to paste links to that text file that will work on iOS (1Writer) and macOS (nvALT).

Note: this assumes you have 1Writer set up to use a single folder, whatever folder nvALT is using. It has no error handling of any kind. Improvements welcome!
